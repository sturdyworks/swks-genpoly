> [Sturdyworks](http://sturdyworks.org) [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) [generator-ng-poly](https://github.com/dustinspecker/generator-ng-poly) Seed Project for AngularJS

Offers you a Yeoman generator to initiate a Web application with the following workflow:

## Purpose

The [generator](https://github.com/dustinspecker/generator-ng-poly) utilized in this project seed focuses on organizing Angular components by feature (home, about, video player, etc.) instead of by type (controller, service, directive, etc.) to encourage the development of self-contained, reusable components. A typical workflow with this generator consists of creating an Angular module ([ng-poly:module](#module)) and then generating controllers, directives, etc. for this module to create a new feature.

## Why swks-poly ?

The code generated by [generator-ng-poly](https://github.com/dustinspecker/generator-ng-poly) is terrific and even allows [Controller As](http://toddmotto.com/digging-into-angulars-controller-as-syntax/) Syntax, but as with all [generators](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r8rJy2Q5p5QORYKcye93UECwOlSgFL24c5fyF7dqhaM/edit#gid=1607194899) much code related to cross-browser support is missing, and since this project seed focuses on [Bootstrap 3.3](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) and [Angular UI]() several code enhancements can be made to optimize rendering webpages on Windows 8.1, Android, etc.

- [ ] [Bootstrap 3.3 Browser and Device Support](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support)
- [ ] [AngularJS 1.2.x Internet Explorer Compatibility](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie)
- [ ] [ngBook AngularJS and Internet Explorer](https://www.ng-book.com/p/AngularJS-and-Internet-Explorer/)
- [x] [Testing on Internet Explorer 8+](https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads)
- [ ] [Google Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/tag/v0.5.0)
- [ ] [Google Web Fundamentals - Multi-Device Layouts](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/)
- [ ] [Google Web Fundamentals - Device Access & Integration, among others...](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/device-access/stickyness/)

**All of the features above should be completed by the end of 2014**
